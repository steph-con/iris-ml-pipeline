# 🌸 End-to-End Machine Learning with the Iris Dataset

This project is an end-to-end implementation of a **machine learning pipeline** using the classic **Iris dataset**.  
It walks through **data exploration, visualization, model training, evaluation, and comparison**, and is part of my **data science portfolio**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the **core steps in a machine learning workflow**, applied to the Iris dataset.  
This includes:  

- Data exploration & visualization  
- Preparing data for modeling  
- Training and evaluating **six different ML algorithms**  
- Comparing performance  
- Drawing conclusions and discussing next steps  

---

## 📊 Results

- All models performed well, reflecting the clear separability of classes in the Iris dataset.  
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** achieved the highest accuracy on validation data.  
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Logistic Regression also performed strongly.  

🔮 **Next Steps**:  
Future improvements could include hyperparameter tuning, ensemble methods (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting), and testing on other datasets.
